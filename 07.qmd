## **Organization of the Skeletal System**

## **Overview of the Whole Skeletal System**

The skeletal system can be divided into two divisions, the axial and the appendicular divisions. The axial skeleton forms the main axis of the body. It includes the skull, the vertebral column, and the rib cage (see Figure 7.6). The appendicular skeleton consists of all of the bones of the limbs , including the girdles.

## **The Skull**

Activity: In this exercise the objective is to do the following:

- List and identify the cranial and facial bones.
- Locate the major suture lines of the skull and name the bones associated with each.
- Define the paranasal sinuses and identify the location of each.
- Name the bones that make up the walls of the orbit and identify the openings associated with the orbit.
- Identify the bones and structures that form the nasal septum and nasal conchae and locate the hyoid bone.
- Identify the bony openings and markings of the skull.

During this period, you need to identify the bones on the articulated skeleton, disarticulated bones as well as on a picture or diagram. Pair up into working groups. Use the information and figures that follow to identify the bones and required bone markings for the axial skeleton and label them for later review. These are listed in the objectives above and at the beginning of this lab. Use labelling tape to identify the bones and markings. Have another group come to your demonstration table to review your identifications. Once finished ask your lab instructor to review your identifications.

As you prepare for the upcoming lab practical you should take pictures of the skeleton and disarticulated bones. Later you should identify and label the bones and their features. Include these identifications in your study guide.
