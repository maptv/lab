## **Lab Activities**

### **Lab Activity 4.1**

## **Epithelial Tissues: Classification of the Epithelial Tissues**

Epithelial tissues are classified by a) the number of layers of cells in the tissue and b) the shape of the cells within the tissue. A single layer of cells is defined as a simple layer whereas a tissue of multiple layers is called stratified. The name of the stratified tissue is based on the type of cells that are found in the apical surface. A pseudostratified tissue consists of a single layer of irregularly shaped cells. This construction led to the appearance that the tissue consisted of more than one layer.

The shape of the cells in a single layer is indicative of the function of the cells. Cells that have a flattened shape are squamous type cells. Simple squamous tissue if located in those organs whose function is to allow easy passage of molecules or compounds through the cell (e. g., alveolar tissue in the lung, and the lining of kidney tubules). Simple cuboidal cells look box-like and are associated with those tissues that are active in absorption and secretion. Finally, columnar cells are taller than they are wide.; their nucleus is usually located next to the basilar surface of the cell. These cells are also active in secretion and absorption of molecules.
