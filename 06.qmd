- Bones are organs that contain diverse shapes and features. In your assigned group, obtain a set of disarticulated bones or an articulated skeleton from the classroom lab supplies.
- Use the information from your text and Table 6.2 to locate and identify the features in table 6.2 .
- When you identify a feature, label it using tape and have your group mates confirm the identification. Ask your instructor to confirm your identification.

### **Bone Classification based on Shape.**

![](_page_137_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Figure 6.7** Classification of Bones Based on Shape.

- The bones of the skeletal system may be classified into five different categories. From the description of the features in table 6.3, find several bones on the articulated skeleton and label them according to their anatomical shape. Complete the table by providing at least two examples of each bone shape.
- Next, obtain some tape and on a skeletal model or a set of bones from your disarticulated skeleton classify several bones according to their shapes.
- Complete table 6.3.

**Table 6.3 Bone Classifications Based on Shape**

| Classification | Features                                                         | Example(s) |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Long           | Cylindrical shape; longer<br>than wide                           |            |
| Short          | Cube shaped length,<br>width, and thickness;<br>relatively equal |            |
| Flat           | Thin and wide curved                                             |            |

## **Lab Activity 6.3.**

- Find a dissected bone or a model of a bone and identify the compact and spongy bones based on their location and appearance.
- What are the major anatomical differences between spongy and compact bone?

### **Bone Histology: Compact Bone**

### **Activity 6.4.**

- Have someone obtain a microanatomy human bone model form the storage area.
- Identify and label the features of the compact bone.
- Take a picture of your work for later reference.
- Have a lab mate from another group verify the identifications.

- In groups of two obtain a microscope for this activity.
- Using a light microscope, view the slide of a bone osteon at a magnification of 400x.
- Draw and label each tissue type in the spaces provided. Your information should provide where it would be found in the body along with the magnification of the tissue.
- Take a picture of the magnified osteon with your cell phone for later reference.

**Figure 6.17** Bone Features.

### **Across**

- **4** A bony bulb or structure on a narrow neck is called a(n) \_\_\_\_\_. (4)
- **6** On a bone, a(n) \_\_\_\_\_ is a structure which protrudes from a bone. These are often named for what they protrude toward. (7)
- **7** On the femur, a(n) \_\_\_\_\_ refers to a large, blunt, unevenly shaped process. (10)
- **8** A sharp, axe-like or needle-like projection on a bone is called a(n) \_\_\_\_\_. (5)

- **1** On a bone, a(n) \_\_\_\_\_ is a deep groove or notch. (7)
- **2** The flat, smooth face on a bone where it meets another bone is called a(n) \_\_\_\_\_. (5)
- **3** On a bone, a(n) \_\_\_\_\_ is a narrow ridge. A(n) \_\_\_\_\_ is a smaller version. (5,4)

**7** Blood vessels and nerves may move from one Haversian canal to another by detouring through a(n) \_\_\_\_\_. (11,5)
