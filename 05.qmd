## **Epidermis**

The epidermis consists of stratified epithelial tissue which is primarily composed of keratinocytes. Keratinocytes produce the protein keratin which waterproofs the cells as well as provides additional strength and protection. Other cells found within this layer are the melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin and the Langerhans cells that provide an immune function.

Epidermal Layers: the layers or strata progression from the superficial to the deep layers.

## **Characteristics of this Layer:**

- Mostly keratinocytes
- reproductive actively mitotic division
- produce keratin with cell progression upward keratinization.

### **Strata of the Epidermis:**

- superficial stratum stratum corneum
- intermediate stratum
  - o stratum lucidum absent in "thin" skin.
  - o stratum granulosum
  - o stratum spinosum
- bottom stratum stratum basale (germinitivum)

## **Skin Pigmentation**

Melanocytes. Melanocytes are located in the stratum basale as can be noted in figures 5.10 & 5.11.

**Figure 5.16 The Integumentary System**

## **Across**

- **7** the layer which serves to strengthen the skin and provides our skin with elasticity. It contains hair follicles, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands. (9,5)
- **8** a thin layer of cells in the epidermis lying above the stratum spinosum and below the stratum corneum. (7,10)
- **9** the outermost of the three layers that comprise the skin (9)

### **Down**

**1** the outermost layer of the epidermis comprised of several levels of flattened corneocytes (7,7)

- **2** a more superficial and significantly thinner layer of the dermis, mainly composed of areolar connective tissue. (9,5)
- **3** the lowermost layer of the integumentary system in vertebrates. (10)
- **4** a layer of the epidermis composed of polyhedral keratinocytes. (7,8)
- **5** the deepest layer of the five layers of the epidermis, the external covering of skin in mammals. The stratum. It is a single layer of columnar or cuboidal basal cells (7,6)
- **6** a thin, clear layer of dead skin cells in the epidermis named for its translucent appearance only in areas of thick skin (7,7)

## **Check Your Understanding**

- You are a medical examiner (ME) who is performing an autopsy on a shooting victim. The bullet did not pass through the body and was lodged in the abdomen near the spine. The ME must find and retrieve the bullet to determine its caliber, so she needs to cut through the integument. List the layers that you would cut through from the superficial to the deepest layer.
- It is late in the summer and a young couple that had planted a garden began to freeze and can produce their products for use later in the year. Their garden was very productive, so they were able to store carrots, corn, sweet potatoes, spinach, butternut squash, broccoli, and cantaloupe for use in the winter. They have a four-month-old daughter, and they noticed that after they began feeding her some of the canned food her skin developed a yellowishorange tint. They immediately took her to the general practitioner (GP), and he checked out the child. Following the examination, he returned the child to the parents and with a smirk and gleam in his eyes he indicated that the child was fine but cautioned them that they should vary her diet. Explain why the GP is not concerned about the child's skin condition?

• Discuss how the Integumentary system's skin helps to regulate your body temperature, when your body temperature rises above normal.

• How would you explain why a light skinned individual would be more susceptible to malignant melanoma?
