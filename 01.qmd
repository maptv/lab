## **Lab Activity 1.3**

## **Labeling Anatomical and Regional Terminology**

-   Obtain labeling tape and one of the models or skeletons (e.g., a torso model, mini muscle person torso, skeleton)
-   Write the directional terms from activity 1.2 on the model.
-   Once you are done, have another group check your accuracy. Make corrections if needed.
-   Then, have your instructor or Lab Instructor check your accuracy.
-   Take pictures of your work to use as a study guide.

## **Applying Anatomical and Regional Terminology**

Use appropriate anatomical and regional terminology to fill in the blanks in the statements below.

| Index | Fill in the blank |
|----|----|
| 1 | The elbow is located \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to the wrist. |
| 2 | The umbilicus is located \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to the sternum. |
| 3 | The nose is located \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to the ears. |
| 4 | The mouth is located \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to the chin. |
| 5 | A papercut that does not penetrate the skin would be considered as a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ wound; however, a puncture wound from a nail penetrating the skin would be considered as a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ wound. |
| 6 | A wound on the elbow would be \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to the elbow. |
