## **Lab Activity 1.3**

## **Labeling Anatomical and Regional Terminology**

-   Obtain labeling tape and one of the models or skeletons ( e.g., a torso model, mini muscle person torso, skeleton)
-   Write the directional terms from activity 1.2 on the model.
-   Once you are done, have another group check your accuracy. Make corrections if needed.
-   Then, have your instructor or Lab Instructor check your accuracy.
-   Take pictures of your work to use as a study guide.

## **Applying Anatomical and Regional Terminology**

Use appropriate anatomical and regional terminology to fill in the blanks in the statements below.

| 1\. | The elbow is located to the wrist. | superficial |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 2\. | The umbilicus is located to the sternum. |  |
| 3\. | The nose is located and |  |
|  | to the ears. |  |
| 4\. | The mouth is located to the chin. |  |
| 5\. | A papercut that does not penetrate the skin would be considered as a |  |
|  | wound; however, a puncture wound from a |  |
|  | nail penetrating the skin would be considered as a |  |
|  | wound. |  |
| 6\. | A wound on the elbow would be to the elbow. |  |

## **Lab Activity 1.5**

## **Applying Anatomical and Regional Terminology**

Next, using the definition of anatomical position and correct anatomical language, take turns with your lab partner to give simple, one-movement verbal instructions to transition from the given starting positions (listed in the table below), so that the other person ends up in anatomical position. Write your detailed step-by-step instructions on the provided table.

| Starting Position | Instructions Given to Move to<br>Anatomical Position |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Example: Standing from a<br>Half Spinal Twist<br>with the<br>feet placed to the left, the<br>torso twisted away from you<br>and the head facing at a<br>slight angle to the right,<br>away from you.<br>Figure 1.6 | Example:<br>•<br>Rotate the mental region<br>anteriorly and medially.<br>•<br>Rotate the entire body 180<br>degrees to the left.<br>•<br>Position palmar region<br>anteriorly |
| 1: From lying face-up on the<br>ground with their head,<br>back, hands, and feet on the<br>floor with both knees bent<br>Figure 1.7 |  |
| 2: From a seated position<br>on the floor with their legs<br>straight and arms folded<br>across their chest<br>Figure 1.8 |  |
