This lab manual was written for a one-semester Anatomy and Physiology course such as the Biology 109 Introduction to Human Biology taught at the Community College of Baltimore County. This workbook is written to complement a one-semester Anatomy and Physiology text. The subject material is based on the course objectives developed by the Community College of Baltimore County's Biology 109 course committee.

The completion of this work was supported by a Community College of Baltimore County Summer Grant during the summer of 2024. A special note of thanks goes to President Sandra Kurtinitis, Ph.D. and the Provost & Vice President of Academics and Student Joaquin Martinez, Ph.D. of the Community College of Baltimore County for their constant support and encouragement for those who create OER and open pedagogy curriculum.
